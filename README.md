# Image-Processing-Using-Element-Wise-Processes

In this paper, we presented some of the basic concepts in image processing from our own perspective and were able to implement them in many examples. From our study, we concluded
the following:

- Human perception plays an important role in the way we analyze images, and we should always make sure that our implementations are perception-bias-free.
- Thereâ€™s a difference between linear algebra coordinates and digitized image coordinates
- Simple implementations of element-wise operations can be used as powerful tools to analyze images
- Images can be displayed based on intensity level statistics using binning, where we can extract useful pieces of information about the intensity levels from this method.
- Manipulating the intensity levels in an image can allow us to highlight, dim, or change some features in an image.
